# P1-LoRa bridge
Send P1 meter telegrams from DSMR digital meters over long range (LoRa) to a WiFi enabled receiver with this firmware for ESP32 microcontrollers and Semtech SX1276/77/78/79 radios.

This is the code for the transmitter connected to your P1 digital meter port. For the receiver (and documentation), see [this repository](https://github.com/plan-d-io/P1-LoRa-receiver).
